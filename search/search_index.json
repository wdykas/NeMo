NVIDIA RIVA has long been the toolkit that enables efficient deployment of NeMo models. In recent months, NeMo Megatron supports training and inference on large language models (upto 1 trillion parameters !). As NeMo becomes capable of more advanced tasks, such as p-tuning / prompt tuning of NeMo Megatron models , domain adaptation of ASR models using Adapter modules , customizable generative TTS models and much more, we introduce this website as a collection of blog posts and announcements for: Technical deep dives of NeMo's capabilities Presenting state-of-the-art research results Announcing new capabilities and domains of research that our team will work on.
